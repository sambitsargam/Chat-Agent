# AgentChat: Bridging Blockchain with SMS and WhatsApp Messaging

AgentChat is an innovative SMS and WhatsApp messaging agent built on Mode Chain. It empowers users to perform on-chain transactions, send funds, Currency conversion, Real time currency data, and even create and manage smart contractsâ€”all through simple text-based communication. This approach bridges the gap between advanced blockchain functionalities and mainstream communication platforms.
